## Your Turn 1: Consider

1. What do you do when you want to learn a new package?

## Your Turn 2

1. Open `vignettes/intro-to-avalanchr.Rmd`.
2. Let's add some more content before we knit this vignette. Lines 27-29 have an R Markdown code chunk. On line 28, fill in the blank with this code: `db_con("residents_per_sector")`
3. Let's also add some examples of the summarizing and plotting functions. On line 57, fill in the blank with `count_donations()`. On line 62, use `plot_donations()`
4. Knit the vignette. If you're having trouble finding some of your functions, try re-loading or documenting and re-building.

**Finish early? Try this stretch goal:**

Create a new vignette with `use_vignette()`. Set the `name` argument to "data-dictionary" and `title` to "Data dictionary for avalanchr data sets". We'll set up the data dictionary in the next module!

## Your Turn 3

1. Run `use_readme_rmd()` to setup a README. Knit the file and take a look.
2. Let's add some badges. Run `use_lifecycle_badge("experimental")` and `use_cran_badge()`. Then, re-knit.


## Take-aways

* Create new vignettes with `use_vignette()`. These R Markdown documents ship with your package and are great for broad introductions and complex topics.
* Create a README with `use_readme_rmd()` or `use_readme_md()`. These are great for installation instructions, simple introductions, and details on contributing, as well as other technical information.
* Add more examples for granular introductions where your user wants to know more about specific uses.
